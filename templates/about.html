                <p>Minecraftly was started by our Founder, <a href="http://vi.et" target="_blank">Viet Nguyen</a>, because he was frustrated with the way Minecraft online community is limited. His experience at building a previous Minecraft server that reached 10,000+ daily active players led him to working on this more ambitious project.</p>
                 <div style="height: 10px;"></div>
                <p>Throughout his time at the previous startup, scalability problems in Minecraft became more and more central to his day to day, yet Microsoft’s way of solving problems not adapting beyond what had previously existed for players.</p>
                 <div style="height: 10px;"></div>
                <p>Between that and the macro trends showing that the entire gaming community is shifting towards a leaner way of playing, where over 65% of gamers will be content creators by 2020, the need for a new way of playing together on a simple, interconnected platform has never been so large.</p>
                 <div style="height: 10px;"></div>
                <p>So in February 2015, Viet set about building Minecraftly Cloud Platform. As a single founder, he rallied and got the support from Microsoft, Google, Amazon, and Stripe, a weird occurance for a young international founder from Vietnam. The company has grown to 6 employees in less than a year.</p>
                 <div style="height: 10px;"></div>
                <p>Our mission is to redefine how we play Minecraft online. To facilitate the future of MMO scalability by making everyone’s way of playing, more private, while at the same time, less separated and more connected. We want to make the way we play together, easier, more transparent and remove the shackles of cluttered, transactional hosting industry sites and shady content providers who don’t facilitate free flowing platform online today.</p>
